This is a backend for the Âµg Project's network location provider that uses locally acquired WiFi AP data to resolve user location.

This backend consists of two parts sharing a common database. One part passively
monitors the GPS. If the GPS has acquired and has a good position accuracy, then
the WiFi APs detected by the phone are stored.

The other part is the actual location provider which uses the database to
estimate location when the GPS is not available or has not yet gotten its first
fix. The use of stored WiFi AP can dramatically decrease the GPS time to first
fix.

This backend performs no network data. All data acquired by the phone stays on
the phone and no queries are made to a centralized AP location provider.
